Installation
`````````````

- After installing prosilica modules :ref:`installation`

- And probably Tango server :ref:`tango_installation`


Configuration
``````````````

- First you have to setup ip addresse of the Prosilica Camera by using *CLIpConfig* (camera/prosilica/sdk/CLIpConfig)
- list of all cameras available : *CLIpConfig -l* (If you do not see any camera, that bad news!)
- finally set ip add : *CLIpConfig -u UNIQUE_NUMBER -s -i 169.254.X.X -n 255.255.255.0 -m FIXED* (It's an example!)
- Then in the Prosilica Tango device set the property *cam_ip_address* to the address previously set.

That's all....
